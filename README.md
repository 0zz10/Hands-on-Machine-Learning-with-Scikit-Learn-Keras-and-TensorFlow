# Hands-on ML with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TF by Aurelien Geron




<div style="text-align:center"><img style="width:100%" src="static/imgs/book_cover.png"></div>

- This Books assumes you know close to nothing about machine learning.
- We will cover a large number of machine learning techniques, from the most simpleset and widely used (Linear Regression) to deep learning techniques that win competitions.
- We will be using production-ready Python frameworks
    - Scikit-Learn
    - Keras
    - TensorFlow
- This book favors a hands-on approach through a series of working examples and just a little bit of theory.
- Prerequesites
    - Some Python programming experience
    - Familiarity with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
    - A reasonable understanding of college-level math (calculus, probability, Linear Algebra, and statistics)
- The first part of the book is mostly based on Scikit-Learn, while the 2nd part is using Keras/TensorFlow.
