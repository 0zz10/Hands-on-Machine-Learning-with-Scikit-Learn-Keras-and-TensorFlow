    "            - An agent observes the environment, selects an action, gets a reward, and updates its policy.\n",
    "- Batch & Online Learning\n",
    "    - Another criterion to classify a machine learning algorithm is whether it learns from an incoming stream of data or not.\n",
    "    - Batch Learning\n",
    "        - In batch learning, the model is incapable of incrementally learning, It first learns from all of the available data offline, and then get deployed to produce predictions without feeding it any new data points.\n",
    "        - Another name of batch learning is Offline Learning.\n",
    "    - Online Learning\n",
    "        - In online learning, you train data incrementally by continuously feeding it data instances as they come.\n",
    "            - Either individually or in small groups of instances called *mini-batches*.\n",
    "        - Each learning step is fast and cheap, so the system can learn as data comes, on the fly.\n",
    "        - Online learning is great for system that receive data in a continuous flow.\n",
    "        - Think about Online learning as incremental learning.\n",
    "        - One important aspect of online learning is how fast the learning algorithm should adapt to new data points\n",
    "            - With a big learning rate — the model tends to forget past data and lean heavily towards new data points.\n",
    "            - With a small learning rate — the model tends to slightly adapt to new data points but keeps its knowledge on old data points mostly intact.\n",
    "        - A big challenge with online learning algorithms is that they can be damaged with bad incoming data points and clients will notice that on the fly\n",
    "            - To mitigate this, you can:\n",
    "                - Closely monitor the system through performance metrics, turn off online learning or revert back to a previous model state.\n",
    "                - Clean the data before feeding it to the model by scanning it for anomaly/outlier detection\n",
    "- Instance-based versus Model-based Learning\n",
    "    - One other way to categorize machine learning algorithms is how they generalize\n",
    "    - There are two approaches to generalization: instance-based approaches and model-based approaches.\n",
    "    - Instance-based Learning\n",
    "        - Similarity-based comparison, a new data point would be classified based on its similarity to the target group in the training set, this would require a measure of similarity.\n",
    "    - Model-based Learning\n",
    "        - Another way to make predictions is to build a model for each class of data points and then use the model to classify a new data point (from the validation/test/production environment).\n",

    "- Insufficient quantity of training data\n",
    "    - Even for very simple ml algorihtms, it takes thousands of examples for it to recognize Cat/Dog.\n",
    "    - A famous paper showed the many algorithms, ranging from very simple ones to complex, perform relatively the same when given enough data.\n",
    "        - The authors argued that we should reconsider where companies should invest their money, in algorithms development or in data corpuses engineering.\n",
    "- Non-representative training data\n",
    "    - In order to generalize well, It's important that your training data be representative of the data that you want to use the system for\n",
    "    - If the sample is too small, you will have sampling noise.\n",
    "    - But even large samples can be non-representative if the sampling method is flawed, this is called **sampling bias**.\n",
    "        - Example of sampling bias — Non-response bias.\n",
    "- Poor quality data\n",
    "    - Obviously, if your training data is full of outliers, errors, and noise, it will make it harder for the algorithm to detect the underlying patterns, resulting in a bad model.\n",
    "    - It's often well worth the time to sit down and properly clean and investigate your data before doing any modeling.\n",
    "    - Example of data cleaning\n",
    "        - If some instances (data points/rows) are clearly outliers, it may be logical to just discard them or manually fix them.\n",
    "        - if some instances are missing a few features, you have multiple options: Discard the instances, fill them with median, train two models (one w/ features and one w/o it).\n",
    "- Irrelevant features\n",
    "    - You system will only learn if your data contains many relevant features and not so many irrelevant ones.\n",
    "    - A critical part of the success of a machine learning project is what's called **feature engineering** or coming up with features that would produce a quality model, it contains two steps:\n",
    "        - Feature selection: selecting the most useful features to train on.\n",
    "        - Feature Extraction: adding new features based of the existing ones.\n",
    "        - Creating new features by gathering new data.\n",
    "- Overfitting the training data\n",
    "    - Say you visited a foreign country and a taxi driver ripped you off, that is overfitting, we do it all the time and we adjust our beliefs as we get more data.\n",
    "    - Machines, unfortunately, do it as well. \n",
    "    - Overfitting means the predictive system performs well on the training data but fails to generalize.\n",
    "    - Complex models such as deep neural networks tend to memorize training data noise or even the data sample itself if its small enough.\n",
    "    - Possible solutions\n",
    "        - Select a model with fewer weights/parameters to constrain its predictive power so that it can use only the strongest present patterns\n",
    "        - Gather more training data\n",
    "        - Reduce the noise in the training data, fix errors and eliminate outliers.\n",
    "    - Constraining a model to make it simpler and fighting overfitting is called **regularization**.\n",
    "    - In the case a a simple linear model, it has two degrees of freedom (2 parameters)\n",
    "    - If we let the algorithm change one parameter's values freely but have a set interval around parameter 2, it will have a between 1 and 2 degree of freedom.\n",
    "    - You want a good balance between keeping the model as simple as possible while giving the model the ability to capture out of training data patterns.\n",
    "    - Regularization can be controlled using hyperparameters, hyperparameters describe how the model should learn, not the parameters of the model itself.\n",
    "- Underfitting the Training Data\n",
    "    - Underfitting is the opposite of overfitting\n",
    "    - It occurs when your model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the training data \n",
    "    - Here are solutions to the problem\n",
    "        - Select a more powerful model, with more parameters\n",
    "        - Feed better features to the learning algorithm (feature engineering)\n",
    "        - Reduce the constraints on the model (reduce regularization)"

    "## Testing & Validating\n",
    "\n",
    "- You evaluate your model by splitting your data into two sets: training and testing data sets.\n",
    "- You only care about out-of-training error, or generalization error, as it is representative of the model's performance in a production environment.\n",
    "- If your training error is low but your testing error is high, this means that you model is overfitting.\n",
    "- It's common to use 80% of the data for training and the remaining 20% for testing.\n",
    "    - But it's dependent on the size of the original data set, the bigger it is, the less percent you can take as a testing set.\n",
    "- Hyper-parameter tuning & model selection\n",
    "    - If you fine-tune regularization parameters on the test set, you are sort of overfitting to it, so you need another data set for Hyper-parameter tuning, called **validation set**.\n",
    "    - The validation set should be set aside from the training set. \n",
    "    - After the holdout validation process (fine-tuning the hyper-parameters) you traing the model on the full training set (with validation) & evaluate on the test set.\n",
    "    - A solution to setting aside a large validation set is to perform repeated cross-validation.\n",
    "        - It has a drawback though, you have to train the model N-repetitions.\n",
    "- Data Mismatch\n",
    "    - The validation set & the test set must be as representative as possible for the data you will use in production.\n",
    "    - One solution to this when you have a broad range of data is to manually select cases that will show up in production as (validation/test) sets.\n",
    "    - One Problem is that if the algorithm is performing poorly on the validation set you won't know if the cause is overfitting or if the training set isn't good for the task at hand.\n",
    "        - A solution to this is to introduce another validation set, called 'train-dev' set.\n",
    "        - After training you will validate the model on both `train-dev` & validation sets.\n",
    "            - If evaluation is good on `train-dev` & bad on `validation`, this means that the data is not good for the task at hand.\n",
    "            - If evaluation is bad on `train-dev` & bad on `validation`, this means overfitting or the algorithm/overall data is not good.\n",
    "- No Free Lunch Theorem\n",
    "    - **A model is a simplified version of the observations**.\n",
    "        - The simplifications are meant to discard noise and capture generalizable useful patterns that will be captured in production.\n",
    "    - To decide what information to discard and what to keep, you must make assumptions.\n",
    "    - For example, a linear model assumes that the relation between the input & output is fundamentally linear.\n",
    "        - & the distance between the model line and the observations is essentially **noise**.\n",
    "    - **If you make no assumptions about the data, than there is no need to prefer one model over another**"

    "- A model's parameters are the knobs that, collectively, store the learned knowledge of the model, also called weights, they are continuously changed during training to minimize a cost function. Examples are a & b in a y = ax + b linear model.\n",
    "- A learning algorithm's hyper-parameter describes how the algorithm should learn and control the predictive power of the model, example is the learning rate, number of layers in a NN, regularization, batch size, they are set before training and aren't changed during training.\n",

    "\n",
    "**16. If your model performs great on the training data but fails on the test data, What is happening?**\n",

    "\n",
    "**19. What is the purpose of a validation set?**\n",
    "- A validation set is used to fine-tune the models' hyper-parameters, what is called manual training, and leave the test set for the final evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**20. What is the `train-dev` set?, When do you use it? & How do you use it?**\n",
    "- the `train-dev` is a validation set that is taken from a broad training set after performing the train/validation/test split.\n",
    "- We use it when we have a broad training data set (ex. images of all animals) but specific validation/test set (zoo animal pics taken with mobile phones) and we want to correctly interpret the model's evaluation.\n",
    "- We train the model on the training data set, we evaluate on `train-dev` and `validation`, if model performs badly on both, we have an overfitting case, if the model performs good in `train-dev` and badly on `validation` we have a data mismatch we the learning doesn't generalize to our specific production data.\n",
