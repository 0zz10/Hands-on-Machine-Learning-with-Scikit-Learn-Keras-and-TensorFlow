    "- Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. — Arthur Samuel (1959)\n",
    "- A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some task $T$ and some performance measure $P$, if its performance on $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$. — Tom Mitchell (1997)."
