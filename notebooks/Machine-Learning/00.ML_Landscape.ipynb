    "- A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some task $T$ and some performance measure $P$, if its performance on $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$. — Tom Mitchell (1997)."

    "## Types of Machine Learning Systems\n",
    "\n",

    "        - Reinforcement Learning\n",

    "            - An agent observes the environment, selects an action, gets a reward, and updates its policy.\n",
    "- Batch & Online Learning\n",
    "    - Another criterion to classify a machine learning algorithm is whether it learns from an incoming stream of data or not.\n",
    "    - Batch Learning\n",
    "        - In batch learning, the model is incapable of incrementally learning, It first learns from all of the available data offline, and then get deployed to produce predictions without feeding it any new data points.\n",
    "        - Another name of batch learning is Offline Learning.\n",
    "    - Online Learning\n",
    "        - In online learning, you train data incrementally by continuously feeding it data instances as they come.\n",
    "            - Either individually or in small groups of instances called *mini-batches*.\n",
    "        - Each learning step is fast and cheap, so the system can learn as data comes, on the fly.\n",
    "        - Online learning is great for system that receive data in a continuous flow.\n",
    "        - Think about Online learning as incremental learning.\n",
    "        - One important aspect of online learning is how fast the learning algorithm should adapt to new data points\n",
    "            - With a big learning rate — the model tends to forget past data and lean heavily towards new data points.\n",
    "            - With a small learning rate — the model tends to slightly adapt to new data points but keeps its knowledge on old data points mostly intact.\n",
    "        - A big challenge with online learning algorithms is that they can be damaged with bad incoming data points and clients will notice that on the fly\n",
    "            - To mitigate this, you can:\n",
    "                - Closely monitor the system through performance metrics, turn off online learning or revert back to a previous model state.\n",
    "                - Clean the data before feeding it to the model by scanning it for anomaly/outlier detection\n",
    "- Instance-based versus Model-based Learning\n",
    "    - One other way to categorize machine learning algorithms is how they generalize\n",
    "    - There are two approaches to generalization: instance-based approaches and model-based approaches.\n",
    "    - Instance-based Learning\n",
    "        - Similarity-based comparison, a new data point would be classified based on its similarity to the target group in the training set, this would require a measure of similarity.\n",
    "    - Model-based Learning\n",
    "        - Another way to make predictions is to build a model for each class of data points and then use the model to classify a new data point (from the validation/test/production environment).\n",
